# Bloomfield-Garfield Corporation Custom Map 

The Bloomfield-Garfield Corporation is a community-based organization that seeks to revitalize the Bloomfield and Garfield neighborhoods. They have many programs, including one that helps build and maintain affordable housing. I have admired their work from afar and decided to use them as the subject of my work. 

To help develop the color palette, I visited the [organization's website](https://bloomfield-garfield.org/) and downloaded their logo. I uploaded that logo to Canva's color palette tool, producing the results below.

After coming up with my palette, I played around with the colors. I tested them out in different places on the map. One challenge was that the Canvas tool only produced four colors. It would have been easier if I had one or two more colors. After some trial and error, I came up with my design. To help keep me organized, I created a table for where I wanted to use each color. The table is below.
